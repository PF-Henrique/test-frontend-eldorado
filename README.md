Project:
You must implement a simple device management web app. Devices have (Id, category, color,
partNumber). The device category must also be managed by your APP. Types have (id, name).
- Login and authentication is not necessary.
- Web app must have a menu with two options: Category Management, Device
Management.
- You must implement Create, Read and Delete. (Update is not necessary due to time
constraints for this implementation)
- Device:
- Id: (generated automatically. Integer and incremental)
- Category: A dropdown selection you can choose from all categories available.
- Color: Text field, with validation (letters only, max size 16)
- partNumber: positive integer field, with validation.
- Category:
- Id: (generated automatically, integer and incremental)
- Name: Must not be empty. All categories must have a name. Max size 128 chars.
- All fields are mandatory.
- You are free to use any layout but the APP must list all devices and categories, and also
have screens/components that enable the user to create new categories and devices, or
delete them.
